      "Summary: LangChain is a software framework that helps facilitate the integration of large language models (LLMs) into applications. As a language model integration framework, LangChain's use-cases largely overlap with those of language models in general, including document analysis and summarization, chatbots, and code analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page: Model Context Protocol\n",
      "Summary: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard developed by the artificial intelligence company Anthropic for enabling large language model (LLM) applications to interact with external tools, systems, and data sources. Designed to standardize context exchange between AI assistants and software environments, MCP provides a model-agnostic interface for reading files, executing functions, and handling contextual prompts. It was officially announced and open-sourced by Anthropic in November 2024, with subsequent adoption by major AI providers including OpenAI and Google DeepMind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page: Retrieval-augmented generation\n",
      "Summary: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technique that enables generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) models to retrieve and incorporate new information. It modifies interactions with a large language model (LLM) so that the model responds to user queries with reference to a specified set of documents, using this information to supplement information from its pre-existing training data. This allows LLMs to use domain-specific and/or updated information. Use cases include providing chatbot access to internal company data or generating responses based on authoritative sources.\n",
      "RAG improves large language models (LLMs) by incorporating information retrieval before generating responses. Unlike traditional LLMs that rely on static training data, RAG pulls relevant text from databases, uploaded documents, or web sources. According to Ars Technica, \"RAG is a way of improving LLM performance, in essence by blending the LLM process with a web search or other document look-up process to help LLMs stick to the facts.\" This method helps reduce AI hallucinations, which have led to real-world issues like chatbots inventing policies or lawyers citing nonexistent legal cases.\n",
      "By dynamically retrieving information, RAG enables AI to provide more accurate responses without frequent retraining. According to IBM, \"RAG also reduces the need for users to continuously train the model on new data and update its parameters as circumstances evolve. In this way, RAG can lower the computational and financial costs of running LLM-powered chatbots in an enterprise setting.\"\n",
      "Beyond efficiency gains, RAG also allows LLMs to include source references in their responses, enabling users to verify information by reviewing cited documents or original sources. This can provide greater transparency, as users can cross-check retrieved content to ensure accuracy and relevance.\n",
      "The term \"retrieval-augmented generation\" (RAG) was first introduced in 2020 by Douwe Kiela, Patrick Lewis, Ethan Perez, Aleksandra Piktus, Fabio Petroni, Vladimir Karpukhin, Naman Goyal, Heinrich Küttler, Mike Lewis, Wen-tau Yih, Tim Rocktäschel, and Sebastian Riedel in their research paper Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks, at Meta.\n",

      "Summary: The economy of India is a developing mixed economy with a notable public sector in strategic sectors. It is the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP); on a per capita income basis, India ranked 140th by GDP (nominal) and 119th by GDP (PPP). From independence in 1947 until 1991, successive governments followed the Soviet model and promoted protectionist economic policies, with extensive Sovietization, state intervention, demand-side economics, natural resources, bureaucrat-driven enterprises and economic regulation. This is characterised as dirigism, in the form of the Licence Raj. The end of the Cold War and an acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 led to the adoption of a broad economic liberalisation in India and indicative planning. India has about 1,900 public sector companies, with the Indian state having complete control and ownership of railways and highways. The Indian government has major control over banking, insurance, farming, fertilizers and chemicals, airports,  essential utilities. The state also exerts substantial control over digitalization,  telecommunication, supercomputing, space, port and shipping industries, which were effectively nationalised in the mid-1950s but has seen the emergence of key corporate players.\n",
      "Nearly 70% of India's GDP is driven by domestic consumption; the country remains the world's fourth-largest consumer market. Aside private consumption, India's GDP is also fueled by government spending, investments, and exports. In 2022, India was the world's 10th-largest importer and the 8th-largest exporter. India has been a member of the World Trade Organization since 1 January 1995. It ranks 63rd on the ease of doing business index and 40th on the Global Competitiveness Index. India has one of the world's highest number of billionaires along with extreme income inequality. Economists and social scientists often consider India a welfare state. India is officially declared a socialist state as per the constitution. India's overall social welfare spending stood at 8.6% of GDP in 2021-22, which is much lower than the average for OECD nations. With 586 million workers, the Indian labour force is the world's second-largest. Despite having one of the longest working hours, India has one of the lowest workforce productivity levels in the world. Economists say that due to structural economic problems, India is experiencing jobless economic growth.\n",
      "During the Great Recession, the economy faced a mild slowdown. India endorsed Keynesian policy and initiated stimulus measures (both fiscal and monetary) to boost growth and generate demand. In subsequent years, economic growth revived.\n",
      "In 2021–22, the foreign direct investment (FDI) in India was $82 billion. The leading sectors for FDI inflows were the Finance, Banking, Insurance and R&D. India has free trade agreements with several nations and blocs, including ASEAN, SAFTA, Mercosur, South Korea, Japan, Australia, the United Arab Emirates, and several others which are in effect or under negotiating stage. In recent years, independent economists and financial institutions have accused the government of manipulating various economic data, especially GDP growth rate.\n",
      "The service sector makes up more than 50% of GDP and remains the fastest growing sector, while the industrial sector and the agricultural sector employs a majority of the labor force. The Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange are some of the world's largest stock exchanges by market capitalisation. India is the world's sixth-largest manufacturer, representing 2.6% of global manufacturing output. Nearly 65% of India's population is rural, and contributes about 50% of India's GDP. India faces high unemployment, rising income inequality, and a drop in aggregate demand. According to the World Bank, 93% of India's population lived on less than $10 per day, and 99% lived on less than $20 per day \u001b[0m\n",

      "Summary: The economy of India is a developing mixed economy with a notable public sector in strategic sectors. It is the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP); on a per capita income basis, India ranked 140th by GDP (nominal) and 119th by GDP (PPP). From independence in 1947 until 1991, successive governments followed the Soviet model and promoted protectionist economic policies, with extensive Sovietization, state intervention, demand-side economics, natural resources, bureaucrat-driven enterprises and economic regulation. This is characterised as dirigism, in the form of the Licence Raj. The end of the Cold War and an acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 led to the adoption of a broad economic liberalisation in India and indicative planning. India has about 1,900 public sector companies, with the Indian state having complete control and ownership of railways and highways. The Indian government has major control over banking, insurance, farming, fertilizers and chemicals, airports,  essential utilities. The state also exerts substantial control over digitalization,  telecommunication, supercomputing, space, port and shipping industries, which were effectively nationalised in the mid-1950s but has seen the emergence of key corporate players.\n",
      "Nearly 70% of India's GDP is driven by domestic consumption; the country remains the world's fourth-largest consumer market. Aside private consumption, India's GDP is also fueled by government spending, investments, and exports. In 2022, India was the world's 10th-largest importer and the 8th-largest exporter. India has been a member of the World Trade Organization since 1 January 1995. It ranks 63rd on the ease of doing business index and 40th on the Global Competitiveness Index. India has one of the world's highest number of billionaires along with extreme income inequality. Economists and social scientists often consider India a welfare state. India is officially declared a socialist state as per the constitution. India's overall social welfare spending stood at 8.6% of GDP in 2021-22, which is much lower than the average for OECD nations. With 586 million workers, the Indian labour force is the world's second-largest. Despite having one of the longest working hours, India has one of the lowest workforce productivity levels in the world. Economists say that due to structural economic problems, India is experiencing jobless economic growth.\n",
      "During the Great Recession, the economy faced a mild slowdown. India endorsed Keynesian policy and initiated stimulus measures (both fiscal and monetary) to boost growth and generate demand. In subsequent years, economic growth revived.\n",
      "In 2021–22, the foreign direct investment (FDI) in India was $82 billion. The leading sectors for FDI inflows were the Finance, Banking, Insurance and R&D. India has free trade agreements with several nations and blocs, including ASEAN, SAFTA, Mercosur, South Korea, Japan, Australia, the United Arab Emirates, and several others which are in effect or under negotiating stage. In recent years, independent economists and financial institutions have accused the government of manipulating various economic data, especially GDP growth rate.\n",
      "The service sector makes up more than 50% of GDP and remains the fastest growing sector, while the industrial sector and the agricultural sector employs a majority of the labor force. The Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange are some of the world's largest stock exchanges by market capitalisation. India is the world's sixth-largest manufacturer, representing 2.6% of global manufacturing output. Nearly 65% of India's population is rural, and contributes about 50% of India's GDP. India faces high unemployment, rising income inequality, and a drop in aggregate demand. According to the World Bank, 93% of India's population lived on less than $10 per day, and 99% lived on less than $20 per day \u001b[0m\n",

See how to use it on your desktop today.\\n\\n4 min read\\nAug 1, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLLMs have paved the way for the development of new types of agentic applications — and as LLM applications evolve, so must the tooling needed to efficiently develop them. Today, we're announcing LangGraph Studio - the first IDE designed specifically for agent development - in open beta.LangGraph Studio offers a new way to develop LLM applications, providing a specialized agent IDE for visualizing, interacting with, and debugging complex agentic applications. In this blog, we'll give a brief overview of LangGraph and then explore how LangGraph Studio streamlines the development of agentic applications.LangGraph: Balancing agent control with agency  In January 2023, we launched LangGraph, a highly controllable, low-level orchestration framework for building agentic applications. Since then, we've seen  teams build more complex agentic applications for production; in turn, we've heavily invested in LangGraph, leading to a stable 0.1 release this past June.LangGraph features a persistence layer that enables human-in-the-loop interactions, and it excels at building complex (i.e. more than a single LLM call) applications that require highly domain-specific cognitive architecture. Most of the agents we see in production fit this description.LangGraph is fully open source, available in both Python and Javascript. It works with or without LangChain, and integrates seamlessly with LangSmith.LangGraph Studio: Visualize and interact with agent graphs for quick iterationWhile LangGraph offers a new framework for developing agentic applications, we also strongly believe that new tooling is needed to make the development process easier. Building LLM applications differs from traditional software development, requiring different tooling outside of the traditional code editor.Coding is still important to developing LLM applications — after all, production-ready LangGraph applications have complicated custom logic in the nodes and edges of the graphs that are created. We don't aim to replace code editors but, instead, to augment the development experience with tools tailored for LangGraph applications. LangGraph Studio facilitates this by making it easy to visualize and interact with agent graphs, even if development still primarily happens in code. Visualizing graphs helps developers understand their structure. Furthermore, you can modify an agent result (or the logic underlying a specific node) halfway through the agent's trajectory. This creates an iterative process, by letting you interact with and manipulate the state at that point in time.While there is much more to explore, we're excited to introduce LangGraph Studio to start with bringing some of the core features of an agent IDE to the world.How to use LangGraph StudioLangGraph Studio is a desktop app, currently available for Apple Silicon. You can download a version here. Support for more platforms is coming soon.After you download and open LangGraph Studio, you will be prompted to log in with your LangSmith account. All users of LangSmith (including those with free accounts) currently have access to LangGraph Studio while it is in beta. You can sign up for a LangSmith account here.After downloading LangSmith, you can open a directory. At a bare minimum, this directory needs to contain a Python file with a graph defined in it. Next, you will need to create a langgraph.json file containing details such as where the agent is defined, which dependencies to install, and which environment variables to load. This file can be created in the UI, or can exist as a file in the directory already. For an example repository which meets these requirements, see this GitHub repo.After you open a directory, we will build an environment for you agent to run. After it builds, you should see a visualization of the graph along with a box for interacting with the agent.When you interact with the agent, you'll get a stream of real-time information about what steps are happening. You can see the agent decide which tools to call, call those tools, and then continue looping. You can interrupt the agent at any time if veers off course, or you can interrupt the agent to run it in a “debug mode” where it pauses after each step of the graph (so you can walk-through step by step).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0:00\\n\\n                            /0:19\\n\\n\\n1×\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n💡At any point, you can interact with the state of the agent.If you don’t like what the agent responded with at a specific step, you can directly modify the response and then continue with that new response. This can be useful for simulating what would have happened if the agent or a tool returned something different.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0:00\\n\\n                            /0:14\\n\\n\\n1×\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can also modify the underlying code and then replay the node. LangGraph Studio detects changes to the underlying code files, allowing you to update prompts in your code editor and rerun nodes if an agent responds poorly. This can make it much easier to iterate on long-running agents.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0:00\\n\\n                            /0:20\\n\\n\\n1×\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusionBuilding agentic applications differs from traditional software development. While code editors remain important, new IDEs designed for agents are also needed. LangGraph Studio is a step in this direction, and we're excited to see how it enhances your workflow.For more on LangGraph Studio, check out our documentation.

      "Summary: LangChain is a software framework that helps facilitate the integration of large language models (LLMs) into applications. As a language model integration framework, LangChain's use-cases largely overlap with those of language models in general, including document analysis and summarization, chatbots, and code analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page: Model Context Protocol\n",
      "Summary: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard developed by the artificial intelligence company Anthropic for enabling large language model (LLM) applications to interact with external tools, systems, and data sources. Designed to standardize context exchange between AI assistants and software environments, MCP provides a model-agnostic interface for reading files, executing functions, and handling contextual prompts. It was officially announced and open-sourced by Anthropic in November 2024, with subsequent adoption by major AI providers including OpenAI and Google DeepMind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page: Retrieval-augmented generation\n",
      "Summary: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technique that enables generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) models to retrieve and incorporate new information. It modifies interactions with a large language model (LLM) so that the model responds to user queries with reference to a specified set of documents, using this information to supplement information from its pre-existing training data. This allows LLMs to use domain-specific and/or updated information. Use cases include providing chatbot access to internal company data or generating responses based on authoritative sources.\n",
      "RAG improves large language models (LLMs) by incorporating information retrieval before generating responses. Unlike traditional LLMs that rely on static training data, RAG pulls relevant text from databases, uploaded documents, or web sources. According to Ars Technica, \"RAG is a way of improving LLM performance, in essence by blending the LLM process with a web search or other document look-up process to help LLMs stick to the facts.\" This method helps reduce AI hallucinations, which have led to real-world issues like chatbots inventing policies or lawyers citing nonexistent legal cases.\n",
      "By dynamically retrieving information, RAG enables AI to provide more accurate responses without frequent retraining. According to IBM, \"RAG also reduces the need for users to continuously train the model on new data and update its parameters as circumstances evolve. In this way, RAG can lower the computational and financial costs of running LLM-powered chatbots in an enterprise setting.\"\n",
      "Beyond efficiency gains, RAG also allows LLMs to include source references in their responses, enabling users to verify information by reviewing cited documents or original sources. This can provide greater transparency, as users can cross-check retrieved content to ensure accuracy and relevance.\n",
      "The term \"retrieval-augmented generation\" (RAG) was first introduced in 2020 by Douwe Kiela, Patrick Lewis, Ethan Perez, Aleksandra Piktus, Fabio Petroni, Vladimir Karpukhin, Naman Goyal, Heinrich Küttler, Mike Lewis, Wen-tau Yih, Tim Rocktäschel, and Sebastian Riedel in their research paper Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks, at Meta.\n",

Building LLM applications differs from traditional software development, requiring different tooling outside of the traditional code editor.Coding is still important to developing LLM applications — after all, production-ready LangGraph applications have complicated custom logic in the nodes and edges of the graphs that are created. We don't aim to replace code editors but, instead, to augment the development experience with tools tailored for LangGraph applications. LangGraph Studio facilitates this by making it easy to visualize and interact with agent graphs, even if development still primarily happens in code. Visualizing graphs helps developers understand their structure. Furthermore, you can modify an agent result (or the logic underlying a specific node) halfway through the agent's trajectory.

      "Page: Western Ghats\n",
      "Summary: The Western Ghats, also known as the Sahyadri, is a mountain range that stretches 1,600 km (990 mi) along the western coast of the Indian peninsula. Covering an area of 160,000 km2 (62,000 sq mi), it traverses the Indian states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu. The range forms an almost continuous chain of mountains along the western edge of the Deccan Plateau, from the Tapti River to Swamithoppe in Kanyakumari district at the southern tip of the Indian peninsula. The Western Ghats meet with the Eastern Ghats at Nilgiris before continuing south.\n",
      "Geologic evidence indicates that the mountains were formed during the break-up of the supercontinent of Gondwana. The mountains came along the west coast of India somewhere in the late Jurassic and early Cretaceous periods when India separated from the African continent. The mountains can be roughly divided into three parts: the northern section with an elevation ranging from 900–1,500 m (3,000–4,900 ft), the middle section starting from the south of Goa with a lower elevation of less than 900 m (3,000 ft), and the southern section where the altitude rises again. The Western Ghats have several peaks that rise above 2,000 m (6,600 ft), with Anamudi (2,695 m (8,842 ft)) being the highest peak. The average elevation is around 1,200 m (3,900 ft).\n",
      "The Western Ghats form one of the major watersheds of India, feeding many perennial river systems that drain almost 40% of the land area of the country. Because of the higher elevation of the Deccan plateau on the west, most rivers flow from eastwards towards the Bay of Bengal, resulting in chiselled eastern slopes and steeper western slopes facing the Arabian Sea. The Western Ghats play an important role in determining the climate and seasons in India. It blocks the rain-bearing monsoon winds flowing eastward from the Arabian Sea, resulting in rainfall along the western coast. By the time the air rises above the mountains, it becomes dry, forming a rain shadow region with very little rainfall on the leeward side towards the interior of the Deccan plateau.\n",
      "The Western Ghats region is a biodiversity hotspot. It contains a large number of different species of flora and fauna, most of which are endemic to this region. At least 325 globally threatened species occur in the Western Ghats. The region was declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2012.\n",

      "Summary: The Nilgiri Mountains (IPA: [n̪iːlɐɡiɾi]) form a part of the Western Ghats in northwestern Tamil Nadu, southern Karnataka and eastern Kerala in South India. They are located at the trijunction of the three states and connect the Western Ghats to the Eastern Ghats.

It is the largest district in Kerala and lies amid the Cardamom Hills of Western Ghats in Kerala. Idukki district contains two municipal towns – Kattappana and Thodupuzha, and five taluks.\n",
      "The district was constituted on 26 January 1972, by taking Peerumade, Udumbanchola, Devikulam taluks of the former High Range division from Kottayam district and the Thodupuzha taluk from Ernakulam district. Its division was previously headquartered at Kottayam city but moved to Kuyilimala near Painavu and Cheruthoni in June 1976. Malayalam and English are the two official administrative languages in the district. Tamil is the second most spoken language in Idukki district after Malayalam.\n",
      "Around 66% of Kerala's power needs come from various hydroelectric power projects in Idukki district. Numerous cash crops and spices are cultivated throughout the district, making it The Spice Garden of Kerala. A significant area in the district is protected as reserved forests and wildlife sanctuaries. The Periyar River is a major river that originates and flows through Idukki. The Pamba River is another important river that originates from Idukki district.\n",
      "Though it is the largest district in the region in terms of area, it has the lowest population density among the districts of Kerala. There are only two municipalities in the district and the urban population is comparatively much lower than the rural population, due to its mountainous nature. The 2,695 metres (8,842 ft) high peak of Anamudi, which is also the highest point of elevation in India outside the Himalayas, lies in the northern portion of the district of Idukki. The Idukki Dam is one of the highest arch dams in Asia.\n",

    "# ReAct Agent\n",
    "Reasoning & Action / Reasoning & Acting\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition : \n",
    "* The ReAct framework combines reasoning and acting in a single loop to handle tasks. The agent uses natural language reasoning (thinking through steps) and task actions (performing tasks like calculations or data retrieval)\n",
    "* The agent uses a combination of reasoning steps to guide actions in real-time, using feedback from those actions to further inform the next step in reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it Works\n",
    "* Step 1 : The agent recwives a question or task\n",
    "* Step 2 : It reasons aloud (in natural language) about how to solve it.\n",
    "* Step 3 : Based on its reasoning, it takes actions (e.g. searching a database, calculating something)\n",
    "* Step 4 : The results of these actions are integrated into its reasoning and may trigger further actions.\n",
    "* Step 5 : It repeats the process until it arrives at a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points :\n",
    "* Combining thinking and doing (reasoning and actions)\n",
    "* Performs iterative steps, updating its processes based on action results.\n",
    "* Typically handles complex decision-making scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples :\n",
    "* Original task : \"Calculate the total number of apples in a basket if there are 4 baskets and 7 apples in each.\n",
    "* Reasoning : \"I need to multiply 4 by 7 to get the total number of apples.\"\n",
    "* Action : Perform the multiplication\n",
    "* Result : There are 28 apples.\n",
    "* Reasoning : I am done\n"

    "* Once the AI generates these follow-up questions, it performs an external search(e.g throgh Google or an internal database) to gather the necessary information before formulating a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works:\n",
    "* Step 1 : Receive a complex question\n",
    "* Step 2 : The agent identifies sub-questions or follow-up questions.\n",
    "* Step 3 : It performs a search or fetches answers to these questions from external resources.\n",
    "* Step 4 : The answer are aggregated to provide a complete response.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points : \n",
    "* Emphasize question decomposition.\n",
    "* Relies on external search for sub-questions.\n",
    "* Useful for answering open-ended or broad questions where the answer is not immediately available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example : \n",
    "* Original question : \"How many moons does Jupiter have?\"\n",
    "* Sub-Question : \"What is Jupiter?\"\n",
    "* Sub-question : \"What are moons\"(search)\"\n",
    "* Finally, it retrieves the answer: \"Jupiter has 79 moons.\""
